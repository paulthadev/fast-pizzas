## About The Project

The app called "Fast React Pizza Co." is an easy-to-use platform that allows users to order pizza quickly and easily. The app offers a number of convenience features to help users enjoy their pizza dining experience as quickly and smoothly as possible.

### Main functions:

- Location and Delivery Tracking: The app allows users to use location tracking so they can easily fill in the order address. After ordering, you can see where your pizza is in the delivery process.

- Order Summary and Modification: Users can review their order at any time, including pizza selection, delivery address and summary. During the order, it is possible to change the selected pizza or the delivery address at any time.

- Preferential Order Priority: The application provides the possibility to request a priority order. If the user wants to receive the pizza urgently, the application automatically adds the priority price to the total, so the user can enjoy the fastest possible delivery.

- Automatic Order Number Generation: A unique order number is generated for each order. This ID allows users to return to the app at any time to check the status or details of their order.

The purpose of the "Fast React Pizza" application is to provide a fast, convenient and unique pizza ordering experience. Location, order modification, preferred order priority and order number combine to allow users to order and enjoy fresh and delicious pizza with full control.

## Built in

1. Vite
2. React
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Javascript
5. React Router
6. Redux Toolkit

## What I learned

During the implementation with the Vite framework, React and Tailwind CSS, several important lessons emerged:

Vite Framework: During the project, I learned about the Vite framework, which provides a fast and efficient development environment for modern web applications. I learned about its basic features, configuration, and faster development time.

React Application Development: The project helped me delve deeper into the React application development process. I learned about component-based development, state management, and effective UI design and implementation.

Using Tailwind CSS: While using Tailwind CSS in the application, I got to know the utility-first CSS framework. I learned about defining simple styles, their flexible combinability, and fast and efficient style development.

Use of location tracking: I used location tracking throughout the project so that users could easily select their shipping address.

Order Process Management: The order process implemented in the application gave users the opportunity to summarize and modify the order, as well as to use individual order numbers. I learned about the importance of managing the ordering process and optimizing the user experience.

Performance Optimization: By taking advantage of the Vite framework, I learned about project performance optimization, such as faster development time and faster application loading.

Together, these aspects help me develop modern web applications efficiently and have a broad knowledge of using Vite, React and Tailwind CSS in real-world project development.
